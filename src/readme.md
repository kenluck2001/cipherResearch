# Cryptography Experiments

This is where I put some quick dirty implementations of a few cryptographic cipher. This is strictly for learning purposes and show not be used in production.
No attempting was made to perform constant-time cryptography, so timing attack abound in our implementation.

The following cryptographic ciphers are implemented:
- AES 
- DES


The following modes are currently supported.
- ECB
- CBC

Solutions tested on 
+ Python 2.7.16 
+ Python 3.5.2


This is an educational pursuit. Thanks.
